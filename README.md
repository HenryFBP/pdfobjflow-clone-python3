# pdfobjflow-clone-python3

Taken from <https://bitbucket.org/sebastiendamaye/pdfobjflow/src/master/>, which is Python2 code that does not work with Python 3.

> This program is meant to be used with pdf-parser from Didier Stevens. It reads the output from pdf-parser and creates the map of the objects flows under the form of a DOT file. You can then use the dot utility to export an image (e.g. PNG file).
